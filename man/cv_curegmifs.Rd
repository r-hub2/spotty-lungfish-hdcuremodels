}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "\code{formula}" (or one that can be
coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.
The response must be a survival object as returned by the \code{Surv}
function while the variables on the right side of the formula are the
covariates that are included in the incidence portion of the model.}

\item{data}{a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in the
\code{formula} or in the \code{subset} argument. Rows with missing data are
omitted (only \code{na.action = na.omit} is operational) therefore users may
want to impute missing data prior to calling this function.}

\item{subset}{an optional expression indicating which subset of observations
to be used in the fitting process, either a numeric or factor variable should
be used in subset, not a character variable. All observations are included by
default.}

\item{x_latency}{specifies the variables to be included in the latency
portion of the model and can be either a matrix of predictors, a model
formula with the right hand side specifying the latency variables, or the
same data.frame passed to the \code{data} parameter. Note that when using the
model formula syntax for \code{x_latency} it cannot handle
\code{x_latency = ~ .}.}

\item{model}{type of regression model to use for the latency portion of
mixture cure model. Can be "weibull" or "exponential"; default is "weibull".}

\item{penalty_factor_inc}{vector of binary indicators representing the
penalty to apply to each incidence coefficient: 0 implies no shrinkage and 1
implies shrinkage. If not supplied, 1 is applied to all incidence variables.}

\item{penalty_factor_lat}{vector of binary indicators representing the
penalty to apply to each latency coefficient: 0 implies no shrinkage and 1
implies shrinkage. If not supplied, 1 is applied to all latency variables.}

\item{fdr_control}{logical, if TRUE, model-X knockoffs are used for
FDR-controlled variable selection and indices of selected variables are
returned (default is FALSE).}

\item{fdr}{numeric value in (0, 1) range specifying the target FDR level to
use for variable selection when \code{fdr_control=TRUE} (default is 0.2).}

\item{epsilon}{small numeric value reflecting incremental value used to
update a coefficient at a given step (default is 0.001).}

\item{thresh}{small numeric value. The iterative process stops when the
differences between successive expected penalized complete-data
log-likelihoods for both incidence and latency components are less than this
specified level of tolerance (default is 10^-5).}

\item{scale}{logical, if TRUE the predictors are centered and scaled.}

\item{maxit}{integer specifying the maximum number of steps to run in the
iterative algorithm (default is 10^4).}

\item{inits}{an optional list specifying the initial values as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{itct} a numeric value for the unpenalized incidence
intercept.
\item \code{b_u} a numeric vector for the unpenalized incidence coefficients.
\item \code{beta_u} a numeric vector for unpenalized latency
coefficients.
\item \code{lambda} a numeric value for the rate parameter.
\item \code{alpha} a numeric value for the shape parameter
when \code{model = "weibull"}.
}
If not supplied or improperly supplied,}

\item{n_folds}{an integer specifying the number of folds for the k-fold
cross-valiation procedure (default is 5).}

\item{measure_inc}{character string specifying the evaluation criterion used
in selecting the optimal \eqn{\lambda_b} which can be either
\itemize{
\item \code{"c"} specifying to use the C-statistic for cure status
weighting (CSW) method proposed by Asano and Hirakawa (2017) to
select both \eqn{\lambda_b} and \eqn{\lambda_{\beta}}
\item \code{"auc"} specifying to use the AUC for cure prediction using the
mean score imputation (MSI) method proposed by Asano et al. (2014) to select
\eqn{\lambda_b} while the C-statistic with CSW is used for
\eqn{\lambda_{\beta}}.
}}

\item{one_se}{logical, if TRUE then the one standard error rule is applied
for selecting the optimal parameters. The one standard error rule selects the
most parsimonious model having evaluation criterion no more than one standard
error worse than that of the best evaluation criterion (default is FALSE).}

\item{cure_cutoff}{numeric value representing the cutoff time value that
represents subjects not experiencing the event by this time are cured. This
value is used to produce a proxy for the unobserved cure status when
calculating C-statistic and AUC (default is 5 representing 5 years). Users
should be careful to note the time scale of their data and adjust this
according to the time scale and clinical application.}

\item{parallel}{logical. If TRUE, parallel processing is performed for K-fold
CV using \code{foreach} and the \pkg{doParallel} package is required.}

\item{seed}{optional integer representing the random seed. Setting the random
seed fosters reproducibility of the results.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if TRUE running information is printed to the console
(default is FALSE).}

\item{na.action}{this function requires complete data so \code{"na.omit"} is
invoked. Users can impute missing data as an alternative prior to model fitting.}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}
}
\value{
\item{b0 }{Estimated intercept for the incidence portion of the
model.}

\item{b }{Estimated coefficients for the incidence portion of the
model.}

\item{beta }{Estimated coefficients for the latency portion of the
model.}

\item{alpha }{Estimated shape parameter if the Weibull model is fit.}

\item{rate }{Estimated rate parameter if the Weibull or exponential
model is fit.}

\item{logLik }{Log-likelihood value.}

\item{selected.step.inc }{Iteration step selected for the incidence
portion of the model using cross-validation. NULL when fdr_control is TRUE.}

\item{selected.step.lat }{Iteration step selected for the latency
portion of the model using cross-validation. NULL when fdr_control is TRUE.}

\item{max.c }{Maximum C-statistic achieved}

\item{max.auc }{Maximum AUC for cure prediction achieved; only output
when \code{measure_inc="auc"}.}

\item{selected_index_inc }{Indices of selected variables for the
incidence portion of the model when \code{fdr_control=TRUE}. If none
selected, \code{int(0)} will be returned.}

\item{selected_index_lat }{Indices of selected variables for the
latency portion of the model when \code{fdr_control=TRUE}. If none selected,
\code{int(0)} will be returned.}

\item{call}{the matched call.}

\description{
Fits a penalized Weibull or exponential mixture cure model using the
generalized monotone incremental forward stagewise (GMIFS) algorithm with
k-fold cross-validation to select the optimal iteration step along the
solution path. When FDR controlled variable selection is used, the model-X
knockoffs method is applied and indices of selected variables are returned.
