\usage{
curegmifs(
  formula,
  data,
  subset,
  x_latency = NULL,
  model = c("weibull", "exponential"),
  penalty_factor_inc = NULL,
  penalty_factor_lat = NULL,
  epsilon = 0.001,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class "\code{formula}" (or one that can be
coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. The
response must be a survival object as returned by the \code{Surv} function
while the variables on the right side of the formula are the covariates that
are included in the incidence portion of the model.}

\item{data}{a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in the
\code{formula} or in the \code{subset} argument. Rows with missing data are
omitted (only \code{na.action = na.omit} is operational) therefore users may
want to impute missing data prior to calling this function.}

\item{subset}{an optional expression indicating which subset of observations
to be used in the fitting process, either a numeric or factor variable should
be used in subset, not a character variable. All observations are included by
default.}

\item{x_latency}{specifies the variables to be included in the latency
portion of the model and can be either a matrix of predictors, a model
formula with the right hand side specifying the latency variables, or the
same data.frame passed to the \code{data} parameter. Note that when using the
model formula syntax for \code{x_latency} it cannot handle
\code{x_latency = ~ .}.}

\item{model}{type of regression model to use for the latency portion of
mixture cure model. Can be "weibull" or "exponential"; default is "weibull".}

\item{penalty_factor_inc}{vector of binary indicators representing the
penalty to apply to each incidence coefficient: 0 implies no shrinkage and 1
implies shrinkage. If not supplied, 1 is applied to all incidence variables.}

\item{penalty_factor_lat}{vector of binary indicators representing the
penalty to apply to each latency coefficient: 0 implies no shrinkage and 1
implies shrinkage. If not supplied, 1 is applied to all latency variables.}

\item{epsilon}{small numeric value reflecting the incremental value used to
update a coefficient at a given step (default is 0.001).}

\item{thresh}{small numeric value. The iterative process stops when the
differences between successive expected penalized
log-likelihoods for both incidence and latency components are less than this
specified level of tolerance (default is 10^-5).}

\item{scale}{logical, if TRUE the predictors are centered and scaled.}

\item{maxit}{integer specifying the maximum number of steps to run in the
iterative algorithm (default is 10^4).}

\item{inits}{an optional list specifying the initial values as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{itct} a numeric value for the unpenalized incidence
intercept.
\item \code{b_u} a numeric vector for the unpenalized incidence coefficients.
\item \code{beta_u} a numeric vector for unpenalized latency
coefficients.
\item \code{lambda} a numeric value for the rate parameter.
\item \code{alpha} a numeric value for the shape parameter
when \code{model = "weibull"}.
}
If not supplied or improperly supplied,
initialization is automatically provided by the function.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if TRUE running information is printed to the
console (default is FALSE).}

\item{suppress_warning}{logical, if TRUE, suppresses echoing the warning that
the maximum number of iterations was reached so that the algorithm may not
have converged. Instead, warning is returned as part of the output with this
message.}

\item{na.action}{this function requires complete data so \code{"na.omit"} is
invoked. Users can impute missing data as an alternative prior to model fitting.}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}
}
\value{
\item{b_path}{Matrix representing the solution path of the
coefficients in the incidence portion of the model. Row is step and
column is variable.}

\item{beta_path}{Matrix representing the solution path of the
coefficients in the latency portion of the model. Row is step and column is
variable.}

\item{b0_path}{Vector representing the solution path of the intercept
in the incidence portion of the model.}

\item{rate_path}{Vector representing the solution path of the rate
parameter for the Weibull or exponential density in the latency portion of
the model.}

\item{logLik}{Vector representing the log-likelihood for each step
in the solution path.}

\item{x_incidence}{Matrix representing the design matrix of the
incidence predictors.}

\item{x_latency}{Matrix representing the design matrix of the latency
predictors.}

\item{y}{Vector representing the survival object response as returned
by the \code{Surv} function }

\item{model}{Character string indicating the type of regression model
used for the latency portion of mixture cure model ("weibull" or
"exponential").}

\item{scale}{Logical value indicating whether the predictors were
centered and scaled.}

\item{alpha_path}{Vector representing the solution path of the shape
parameter for the Weibull density in the latency portion of the model.}

\item{call}{the matched call.}

\item{warning}{message indicating whether the maximum number of
iterations was achieved which may indicate the model did not converge.}
